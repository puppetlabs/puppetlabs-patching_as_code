# @summary
#   Framework for patch management as code. Works alongside the puppetlabs/pe_patch or albatrossflavour/os_patching modules
# 
# @example Using the module with defaults, or controlling options through Hiera
#   include patching_as_code
# 
# @example Forcing the classification of pe_patch on PE 2019.8.0+
#   class {'patching_as_code':
#     classify_pe_patch => true
#   }
# 
# @example Forcing the use of albatrossflavour/os_patching on PE 2019.8.0+
#   class {'patching_as_code':
#     use_pe_patch => false
#   }
# 
# @param [String] patch_group
#   Name of the patch_group for this node. Must match one of the patch groups in $patch_schedule
# @param [Hash] patch_schedule
#   Hash of available patch_schedules. Default schedules are in /data/common.yaml of this module
# @option patch_schedule [String] :day_of_week
#   Day of the week to patch, valid options: 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'
# @option patch_schedule [Integer] :count_of_week
#   Which week in the month to patch, use a number between 1 and 4
# @option patch_schedule [String] :hours
#   Which hours on patch day to patch, define a range as 'HH:MM - HH:MM'
# @option patch_schedule [String] :max_runs
#   How many Puppet runs during the patch window can Puppet install patches. Must be at least 1.
# @option patch_schedule [String] :reboot
#   Reboot behavior, valid options: 'always', 'never', 'ifneeded'
# @param [Array] blocklist
#   List of updates to block from installing
# @param [Array] allowlist
#   List of updates that are allowed to be installed. Any updates not on this list get blocked.
# @param [Hash] pre_patch_commands
#   Hash of command to run before patching
# @option pre_patch_commands [String] :command
#   The pre-patching command to execute
# @option pre_patch_commands [String] :path
#   (optional) The path for the command
# @option pre_patch_commands [String] :provider
#   (optional) The provider for the command
# @param [Hash] post_patch_commands
#   Hash of command to run after patching
# @option post_patch_commands [String] :command
#   The post-patching command to execute
# @option post_patch_commands [String] :path
#   (optional) The path for the command
# @option post_patch_commands [String] :provider
#   (optional) The provider for the command
# @param [Hash] pre_reboot_commands
#   Hash of command to run before rebooting
# @option pre_reboot_commands [String] :command
#   The pre-reboot command to execute
# @option pre_reboot_commands [String] :path
#   (optional) The path for the command
# @option pre_reboot_commands [String] :provider
#   (optional) The provider for the command
# @param [Optional[Boolean]] use_pe_patch
#   Use the pe_patch module if available (PE 2019.8+). Defaults to true.
# @param [Optional[Boolean]] classify_pe_patch
#   Controls if the pe_patch class (PE 2019.8+) is controlled by this module.
#   When enabled, this module will classify the node with pe_patch,
#   and set it's patch_group according to this module's patch_group.
#   When disabled (default), you can use PE's own "PE Patch Management" groups
#   to classify nodes with pe_patch. In that case, please make sure you match
#   the patch_group variable in pe_patch with the patch_group in patching_as_code
# @param [Optional[Boolean]] patch_on_metered_links
#   Controls if patches are installed when the active network connection is a
#   metered link. This setting only has affect for Windows operating systems.
#   When enabled, patching are installed even over a metered link.
#   When disabled (default), patches are not installed over a metered link.
